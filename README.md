# A/B Testing of Website Themes Using RStudio

## Introduction
A/B testing is a method used to compare and evaluate different marketing strategies, designs, or themes. The primary purpose is to make informed decisions based on data to enhance user experience and improve performance metrics. In this project, the aim is to test two themes (Light and Dark) to determine which one looks better on the website.

## Tools
This project utilizes the following tools for analysis and presentation :

- **RStudio**: Version 4.4.1
- **RMarkdown**: Used for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and analysis results.
  
## Methodology
1. Descriptive Statitics : Analyze the data to understand its structure or identify the correlations. Visualize the data to uncover insights.
2. A/B Testing : Define the null and alternative hypotheses and use statistical tests such as the t-test or z-test to determine if there's a significant difference between the two themes.
 
## Summary
This project presents the use of A/B testing to compare two website themes. The results indicate that while the Dark and Light themes are generally similar, the Light theme performs slightly better.
